# cs109_in_vino_veritas
This served as homework for the [CS109 Data Science cource](http://cs109.org) and is represented as a [Jupyter Notebook](HW5.ipynb).

First: We'll examine the wine quality dataset hosted on the [UCI website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). This data records 11 chemical properties (such as the concentrations of sugar, citric acid, alcohol, pH etc.) of thousands of red and white wines from northern Portugal, as well as the quality of the wines, recorded on a scale from 1 to 10.

Second: We explore a number of different methods to predict the quality of a wine Y based on the recorded features X. Formulated as a machine learning problem, we wish to predict the target Y as a function of the features X.

Third: We calibrate our classifier to better accommodate for data imbalance.

Finally: We visualise how the classifier translates different inputs X into a guess for Y by plotting its decision surface.
